# NewSurveyData
I lost the survey project I did in class and had to start over. 

The figures describe the data on rodent weight measurements in the year 1995.  

Figure one is a scatter plot that describes the relation between the mean weights of rodents and the months of the year 1995.
The second figure, figure 2, are box plots that compare the mean weights of male and female rodents of the same year. As one would expect the males were heavier on average. 
The final figure, figure 3, shows the distribution of weight in kg of all the rodents based on their species id.
An ANOVA statistical analysis of the data in figure 3 had an F value of 11370, thus the chances that the average weights of rodents were not dependent on their species identity are extremely low. The overall conclusion is that rodent weight fluctuates slightly over the course of the year, that male rodents are on average larger than females, and the range in mean weight is species-dependent in the rodent taxa.
